TextFileGuys Vision Statement

The TextFileGuys' project for Secure Software Engineering has various purposes.  As a class project, it serves as an assignment and is an effective way to provide experience for the group in software design.

However, at the group level, the project serves as an expansion of knowledge.  To us, this project acts as a method to help us learn new technologies while applying them to a real-world project.  The PenTester project also serves a dual role as teaching us about security tools and the importance of penetration testing.
