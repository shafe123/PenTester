The TextFileGuys Pen Tester project takes security analysis scans from different programs such as NMAP, Nessus, and ZAP and organizes them into an online form that is ready to be presented to upper management and customers. This program is made by security researchers with security concepts baked into the whole development process: from design to implementation.

The Pen Tester project is driven by user supplied content: users are required to submit the scans that will compromise the final report. However the Pen Tester project requires a way to verify the scan that the user submits. This is because every program’s scans have different names for different properties, and because we realize uploading directly to servers must be done with care. This upload ability is accomplished through the use of a plugin structure: the user submits a plugin that defines how to verify scans of that type. With this plugin, the Pen Tester project requires minimal refinement and user interaction on how to define the final report layout.

To allow the program to be more feature rich, a user must register with the program. This allows a user to maintain a database of plugins that she can use over and over again. Users can also belong to groups. This allows her to share the plugins she uploaded with other members of the group. In this manner, both big security companies and one man security shops can utilize this tool to their advantage and save themselves valuable time. Finally once all of the individual scans are uploaded and verified, the final report can be generated. 

As mentioned earlier this tool was created with security baked in from the design phase. The developers went to great length to utilize secure functions and classes provided by ASP.NET C# libraries. The developers also took extensive care to protect user information from unauthorized data extraction attempts such as; Cross Site Scripting, SQL Injection, Session Hijacking, Cookie Manipulation.
